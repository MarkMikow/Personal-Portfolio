          <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace" target="blank">Ada Lovelace</a> was born <b>Augusta Ada King-Noel</b> to the poet Lord Byron and his wife Anne Isabella Milbanke (the only legitimate child they had). Her parents separated a month after she was born and Lord Byron never saw his daughter again. Ada was reared by her mother who encouraged Ada to study mathematics and logic.</p>
          <p>Ada spent much of her childhood in ill-health and was often bedridden. This gave her the opportunity to develop her imagination and at the age of 12, she decided she wanted to fly. Ada began examining the anatomy of birds and experimenting with various materials in order to construct wings. Her research culminated in authoring and illustrating <em>Flyology</em>, her book on the "Art of Flying."</p> 
          <p>Her educational and social pursuits brought her into contact with many luminaries of the day, including Charles Dickens and Michael Farady. Due to her mathematical talents, Ada began a long working relationship with the mathematician Charles Babbage, who bulit the first mechanical computer.</p> 
          <p>Between 1842 and 1843, Ada translated an article written in Italian on the Analytical Engine (a proposed mechanical computer designed by Babbage). Ada supplemented her translation with copious notes. In these notes, Ada describes an algorithm to be used with the Analytical Engine for calculating a sequence of Bernoulli numbers (a sequence of rational numbers defined by an exponential generating function). This algorithm is considered to be the first computer program. Ada also envisioned computers having abilities to go beyond mere number crunching.</p>
