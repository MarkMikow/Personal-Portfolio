              The first musical overtone of any fundamental tone vibrates at twice
              the frequency and is half the string length of the fundamental.
            </p>
            <p>
              With a tape measure, measure the distance from the nut to the bridge
              as shown in <b>Figure 2-1</b>.

                  <p>
                    You will notice that the 12th fret is exactly half the distance from
                    the nut to the bridge. The note played on the 12th fret is the octave
                    of the open string note and vibrates at twice the frequency.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If you pluck the open low E, which vibrates at 82.4 Hz (cycles per
                    second), then its octave lies 12 frets above and vibrates at 164.8
                    cycles per second.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One octave above that E is the high open-string E, which vibrates
                    at 329.6 Hz.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The vibrational frequencies for each open string of a guitar is as follows:
                  </p>
                </div>
                  <div id="frequencies">
                    E:   329.6 Hz<br>B:   246.9 Hz<br>G:   196 Hz<br>D:   146.8 Hz<br>
                    A:   110 Hz<br>E:   82.4 Hz<br>

                  <p>
                    These are the fundamental tones for each string, and each of these
                    tones has its own harmonic series.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The first overtone of the harmonic series is the octave; and, as
                    you can see on the neck of your guitar, the octave contains twelve
                    chromatic notes within it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <b>Lesson 0 - <em>Notes on the Fretboard</em></b> shows all the notes,
                    written as naturals, sharps, and flats of all the notes located on
                    the neck of the guitar.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Now itâ€™s time to start applying your fretboard knowledge!

                            Play the C chromatic scale two octaves, starting on the 8th fret
                            of the low E string. Music manuscript notation and tab for this
                            are given below in <b>Figure 2-2</b>.

                            As you play, name/sing the note you are playing. After you have the
                            fingerings memorized, simultaneously play the C chromatic scale while
                            looking at the corresponding notes written on the music manuscript.
                            In this way, you will quickly develop your ability to read music!

                                  The following exercise given in <b>Figure 2-3</B> uses parts of the
                                    chromatic scale in a wonderful warm-up exercise. In all these
                                    examples, use the tab as a way to learn where the written notes
                                    are on the keyboard. With practice, you will soon be able to read
                                    music notation without the aid of tab.

                                    Set your metronome to a comfortable tempo and play through the
                                    entire exercise. When you can play the exercise with no mistakes
                                    at a certain tempo, then increase the tempo. Strive for accuracy
                                    - listen to every note you play and make sure they sound consistent!
