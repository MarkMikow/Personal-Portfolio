              All of nature is in a state of vibration - from the smallest
              subatomic particle to the greatest galaxy. Albert Einstein, himself,
              stated that “Everything in life is vibration.”

              When a string is plucked, it not only vibrates along its entire length,
              but also along divisions of its length, as shown in <b>Figure 1-1</b>:

              The tone produced from the string vibrating along its entire length
              is called the “fundamental” or “1st harmonic”. Each fractional division
              of its length (1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, 1/6, 1/7, etc.) produces a harmonic
              overtone.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each of these overtones is a unique pitch, and the frequency of the
              pitch is inversely proportional to the string length.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, the 1st overtone of the fundamental tone is termed the
              “2nd harmonic”. The 2nd Harmonic vibrates at ½ the string length and
              its frequency is twice as much as that of the fundamental. The pitch
              of the 2nd harmonic is exactly one octave higher than the fundamental.
            </p>
            <p>
              Likewise, the 3rd Harmonic vibrates at 1/3 the string length and its
              vibrational frequency is three times that of the fundamental. And so on…
            </p>
            <p>
              If the fundamental tone of a string is vibrating at low C (65.4 cycles
              per second, or “Hertz”), the harmonics generated from the vibrating
              string are as follows:

              The Harmonic Series can be considered as “Nature’s Chord” - these
              vibrational frequencies occur naturally when any medium is vibrated.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you pluck a string on a guitar, or when a piano key is struck,
              all these overtones occur simultaneously. The fundamental tone sounds
              the loudest of all the harmonics, but if you listen very carefully,
              you may here the 2nd and 3rd harmonics.

            <div class="exercises">Exercise 1:</div>
          <div class="text">
            <p>
              If you have access to a grand piano, strike a key in the low register
              and you will not only hear the fundamental, but also its octave
              (2nd harmonic) and perhaps the 5th above that (3rd harmonic).

            <p>
              Pluck the low E string on an acoustic guitar or hollow-body electric
              guitar. Listen very carefully. You may hear its 1st overtone, especially
              when the volume of the fundamental is decreasing.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unlike a solid-body electric guitar, an acoustic or hollow body
              electric has a resonating “box,” allowing the overtone frequencies
              of the vibrating string to be more easily heard.

              Wherever you are, simply sit and listen to the sounds occurring in
              your environment. Pick out one sound in particular; for instance,
              the hum of the refrigerator. It doesn’t matter what the sound is -
              what matters is the conscious effort of listening. See if you can
              hear any overtones of the refrigerator hum or whatever sound you are
              listening to. Listen deeper still.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then pick another sound in your environment and listen deeply to it,
              striving to hear its harmonics.
            </p>
            <p>
              With practice, you will develop the ability to hear overtones
              wherever you may be, whether you are outside in nature, inside an
              office building, or at home.
            </p>

              As Einstein said, everything in life is vibration. Moreover, not
              only is all of life vibrating, but all vibrations in life are producing
              a symphony of harmonics.
            </p>
            <p>
              Practice the Art of Listening and not only will you expand your
              aural perceptions, you will quell the constant chatter that occurs
              in the mind!
