          <div class="text">
            <p>
              Welcome to Music Theory for Jazz Blues Guitar! You are embarking
              upon a self-paced magical adventure of musical discovery. By the
              end of this course, you will be able to play anything you want
              anywhere you want on the fretboard of your guitar. The fretboard of
              your guitar is the equivalent of the keyboard of a piano. So first,
              let's learn where every note is located on every string of
              every fret! <b>Figure 0-1</b> displays all the notes located on the first 12 strings
              of a guitar fretboard:
            </p>

              <div class="figures-text">
                Figure 0-1
              </div>
          <div class="text">
            <p>
              The fretboard diagram has intentionally been laid out like a piano
              keyboard - all the white-circled notes are the same as the white keys
              on a piano and all black-circled notes are the same as the black keys.
            </p>
            <p>
              The white-circled notes are all natural notes; that is, they are
              simply themselves. Each black-circled note can be considered as a
              white note either raised or lowered a ½-step.
            </p>
            <p>
              For instance, on the low E-string (the bottom-most string), the
              black-circled note on the 2nd fret is labeled “F#” (“F-sharp”).
              This simply means that its vibrational frequency is ½-step higher
              than F (the relationship of musical tones, vibrational frequency,
              and string length are discussed in the next lesson).
            </p>
            <p>
              You can think of F# as simply F raised a half-step. On a guitar,
              raising a note a ½-step is equivalent to moving your finger up the
              neck (towards the body of the guitar) one fret.
            </p>
            <p>
              F# can also be viewed as the note G lowered a ½-step, which is
              called Gb (G-flat). Sharps and flats are called “accidentals” in
              music, and F# is “enharmonically equivalent” to Gb. This means that
              F# and Gb are really the same note (they have identical pitch),
              even though they are spelled differently. The reason why this occurs
              is due to the way we write music in specific key signatures - which
              you will be doing in future lessons!
            </p>
            <p>
              You may notice that between every 2 white-circled notes (except E
              and F, and B and C), there is a black-circled note. All the
              black-circled notes contain an accidental and can be written either
              with a sharp or a flat.
            </p>
            <p>
              In <b>Figure 0-1</b>, all the notes with accidentals (black-circled
              notes) are sharps. However, we can just as easily label those same
              notes on the fretboard with flats, as is done in <b>Figure 0-2</b>:
            </p>
          </div>

              Figure 0-2
            </div>
          <div class="text">
            <p>
              If we just look at the notes located on the low E-string (with
              accidentals written as sharps), we see:
            </p>

            <p>
              These same notes contained on the low E string of a guitar would
              look like the following on a piano:

              The white notes, written in music manuscript and tablature in 4/4
              time, look like:

              Take a few minutes to look at the notes located on the frets of the
              low E-string of your guitar, along with <b>Figures 0-3, 0-4, and 0-5</b>.
              Correlate in your mind how a musical note on the guitar is represented
              on a piano keyboard, along with its music manuscript and tablature
              notation. It should be noted, however, that the guitar sounds an
              octave higher than its written in manuscript form.
            </p>
            <p>
              The notes on the entire fretboard of a guitar (up to the 12th fret)
              look like the following when written in music manuscript (with note
              names written below each note):
            </p>
          </div>
            <div class="figures">
              <img class="figure-0-6" src="Figure_0_6.png" alt="Figure 0-6">

              <div class="figures-text">
                Figure 0-6
          </div>
                <div class="text">
            <p>
              Notice that there is no tab in <b>Figure 0-6</b>. This is because there
              are numerous ways to navigate from one note to the next on a guitar.
              This is very different than playing a piano, as there is only one
              way to get from one note to another on a keyboard.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is the challenge and the beauty of playing guitar! And this
              is why it is important to spend time learning the notes of the
              fretboard and how they are represented in music manuscript form.
            </p>
            <p>
              It may appear to be overwhelming to memorize where every note is
              located on the fretboard, but it is a lot easier than it seems!
            </p>
            <p>
              In fact, you can learn so much more about anything you want by
              intentionally engaging your body, speech, and mind simultaneously.
            </p>
            <p>
              To learn the notes of the fretboard, try these simple exercises:
            </p>
          </div>
            <div class="exercises">Exercise 1:</div>
          <div class="text">
            <p>
              Place your index finger on F, located on the first fret of the 6th
              string. This engages your body, and your muscle-memory will remember
              that “F” is located here.
            </p>
            <p>
              Pluck the note “F” (it doesn’t matter if you use a pick or your
              finger) while singing the letter “F” aloud. This engages your speech.
              Listen to the note being played on the guitar while you are singing
              the note. It doesn’t matter if you don’t believe that you can sing
              - just do it and don’t let yourself get in the way of your own learning!!!
            </p>
            <p>
              You have now connected the muscle-memory of the physical location of
              your fretboard with the thought (internal speech) and the sound of “F”.
            </p>
            <p>
              While you are doing this, visualize the location in your mind’s eye.
              You have now connected the physical location and sound of the note F
              with your own mental location of F.
            </p>
            <p>
              Continue this exercise with F# / Gb, then G, etc., going all the way
              up the 6th string to the 12th fret (and beyond - go as far as you
              can go on that string).
            </p>
            <p>
              Then do the same procedure along the A-string (5th-string), then
              with the D-string (4th-string), G-string (3rd-string), B-string
              (2nd-string), and finally the upper E-string (1st-string). This is
              assuming that you are in standard guitar tuning.
            </p>
          </div>
              <div class="exercises">Exercise 2:</div>
          <div class="text">
            <p>
              Consider the following sequence of notes:
            </p>
              <div id="circle">
                <p>
                  C - F - Bb - Eb - Ab - Db - Gb/F# - B - E - A - D - G - C
                </p>
              </div>
            <p>
              (This is called the Circle of 5ths and you will be delving very
              deeply into this later!)
            </p>
            <p>
              With your body, speech, and mind - that is, touching/plucking the
              physical location on the fretboard, listening to the sound, singing
              the pitch, and seeing the location in your mind’s eye, play C on the
              6th string, then immediately on the 5th string, then the 4th, etc.
              all the way to the 1st string. Start slowly, then build up speed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Use a metronome and once you can play/sing/visualize the note C
              from one string to the next at 60 bpm (beats per minute), then do
              the same for the note F, and continue in this manner until you have
              gone through all the notes in the Circle of 5ths.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once you can go through the Circle comfortably at 60 bpm, then set
              your metronome to a faster speed and practice! Keep increasing the
              tempo until you can easily play/sing/visualize the Circle of 5ths
              at 120 bpm.
            </p>
          </div>
              <div class="exercises">Exercise 3:</div>
          <div class="text">
            <p>
              Come up with your own progressions of notes and practice <b>Exercise
              2</b> with them. If you have the chords to your favorites songs, then do
              this exercise with the root of each chord. The “root” is the letter
              part of the name of the chord. For instance, the root of a G minor
              7th chord is “G”. If you are doing this exercise with a song that
              has a G minor 7th chord, then play/sing/visualize the note G on e
              very string of your guitar.
            </p>
            <p>
              By doing these exercises, you will develop a firm foundation upon
              which you will soon be building chords, arpeggios, and scales.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can even do this exercise away from your guitar, (thus anywhere
              you want!), using your mental vision, internal speech, and pretending
              that you are placing your finger on the correct location of each note
              you are “playing”.
